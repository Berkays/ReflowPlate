## About

This project contains required PCB design files. This board is mainly designed around the [DerSpatz V1.1 design](https://github.com/DerSpatz/PCB-reflow-solder-heat-plate) but ported to STM32 MCU platform. As the board is designed entirely in EasyEDA, you can easily order this board with parts assembled. Basic parts are used whenever possible to reduce the costs. I would recommend ordering the hot plate as an aluminum PCB as it has more or less the same cost.

Public EasyEda project can be found [here](https://oshwlab.com/berkaygursoy/reflowplate).
